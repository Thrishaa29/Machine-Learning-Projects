Tasks 
Task 1 : House  Price Prediction

Predicting house prices is a common use case in real estate analytics. By analyzing various features of houses, such as size, location, number of bedrooms, and more, we can build models to estimate the market value of properties.

This project uses a dataset of house prices and various machine learning algorithms to build a predictive model. The goal is to find the best model that accurately predicts house prices.

Task 2 : Heart Disease Prediction

This repository contains the code and resources for building and evaluating a machine learning model to predict the likelihood of heart disease in patients. The model leverages various clinical and demographic features to provide a prediction that can assist in early diagnosis and treatment.

Heart disease is one of the leading causes of death worldwide. Early detection and treatment can significantly improve outcomes for patients. This project aims to develop a predictive model using machine learning techniques to estimate the risk of heart disease based on various health indicators.

Task 3: Image Classification Using CIFAR - 10 

This repository contains an image classification model using the CIFAR-10 dataset. The CIFAR-10 dataset consists of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes, with 6,000 images per class. This project aims to build and train a convolutional neural network (CNN) to classify these images.
